# WavConfigTool
WavConfigTool is a program for fastest configuration of UTAU voicebanks.

Instead of configuring each alias, you can place areas of each phoneme, and the program does the rest. The idea is also that any kind of reclist can be used in this program by making settings files. 

Currently there are settings for reclist of such languages: 
- Russian
- Brazil
- Spanish
- Japanese

Settings files can be found [here](https://github.com/HeidenBZR/WavConfigSettings).
